## My Projects
### [OAUTH FLOWS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oauth-flows/dandckbjghfejnhmnhloigndkeabdbbo)
- Chrome Extension (1000+ downloads)
- private github repo (not available public)

A chrome extension that built to ease my work troubleshooting the applications we moved from on-prem to cloud. There were a lot of redirects happening and too much noise, this chrome extension makes it easy to TS and also see in cleartext the transmitted password and OTP. 

## My Repositories

### [CODEWARS JS Repo](https://github.com/scripturesdev/CodeWars)
[Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/)

I am solving various problems in Javascript/NODEJS that are on the Codewars.com website and uploading my solutions to my github repository. I learn alot from other peoples solutions as well which become available when solving a challenge. I look at the solution I like and try to understand it to improve my code. This has become my evening fun recently!



### General Assembly JS bootcamp

This repository is private as it contains class material from the bootcamp. I enjoyed the bootcamp as we learned about alot of different things including:
JS, Jquery, CSS, HTML, DOM and much more..
